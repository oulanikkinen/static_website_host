    "## Use a domain name\n",
    "\n",
    "To host a website, I first need a domain name in order to access it easily and safely.\n",
    "To get a domain name, I have two choices: buy the domain name either from AWS or from a third-party domain registrar.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will quickly go over the main difference betweens these two choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Never purchased or handled a domain name\n",
    "The simplest and most comfortable method is to buy your domain at AWS, it is relatively simple to do and you can skip the step of creating a hosted zone and link your domain to it, which can sometimes be a bit complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Already purchased or handled domain names with a third-party domain registrar\n",
    "Do as you wish, if you have a domain registrar that you care about, you are free to buy your domain from it. \n",
    "However, you will have to create a hosted zone and link your domain to it and I will not go through it in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A.\tBuy a domain from AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "For those wishing to purchase their domain name from AWS, follow these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, go to *Route 53*, then select **Register domain** in order to register a domain name with AWS:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Route 53 Dashboard](images/route-53-dashboard.png ':size=600')\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, choose the domain name of your choice and check if it is available via the **Check** button. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the chosen domain is *cif-domain-name-for-aws*, and it is available for any URL extension. Choose the domain extension you want by clicking on **Add to cart**, and proceed to the purchase by pressing **Continue**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Choose domain name](images/choose-domain-name.png ':size=700')\n",
    "\n",
    "To take ownership of a domain, it is necessary to provide personal information (name, first name, address ...); this information is crucial to prove that the domain belongs to you, so **make sure not to provide false information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who want to preserve their anonymity on the internet, don't worry, it is possible to activate Privacy Protection (also called WHOIS privacy) so that your data will not be visible to any user making WHOIS queries on your domain name. Personally, I recommend you to activate it, because I even used VPN to relocate myself to USA side of world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fair warning**: `Some domain extensions do not benefit from this protection of private data (e.g. the .fr extension), so it is important that you select a domain extension that applies this protection (e.g. the .com extension).`\n",
    "\n",
    "After everything filled, we can move onwards:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Contact Details](images/contact-details-for-domain.png ':size=550')\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I am asked if I want to activate the automatic renewal of your domain name; in other words, once the domain expires after one year of use, it will be automatically renewed for one year. This allows me to not forget to renew domain name, and to see it bought by someone else: I recommend you to activate the automatic renewal.\n",
    "However, if you only want to use this domain for one year or once, like I did for this project, do not activate the automatic renewal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the purchase of my domain, all that remains is to accept the AWS Domain Name Registration Agreement, and to check the email sent by AWS:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Complete Order](images/complete-order.png ':size=700')\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I have in my possession a domain name hosted at AWS. Next step is to create a hosted zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B.\tBuy a domain from a third-party domain registrar\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who prefer to buy or use their domain name from a third-party domain registrar, I couldn't give you a detailed explanation of how to do it, since there are an endless number of hosting companies offering this service.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know which third-party domain registrar to go to, I suggest you do your research on the internet and find the one that suits you best; otherwise, don't complicate things and buy a domain from AWS by following the steps above.\n",

    "## Create a hosted zone\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the basics and before continuing, I wanna answer the key question: \"What is a hosted zone?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS explains it the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A hosted zone is a container for records, and records contain information about how you want to route traffic for a specific domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (acme.example.com, zenith.example.com). A hosted zone and the corresponding domain have the same name.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_en/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-working-with.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know little better what a hosted zone is, let's create one:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Domain name with AWS\n",
    "A hosted zone has been automatically created and there is nothing need to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Domain name with a third-party domain registrar\n",
    "Because the AWS has created a hosted zone automatically for their Domain, I will go through how to create hosted zone if third-party domain is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I created hosted zone, where it is possible to specify domain name, in the example *cif-project.com*; then I specified that I want my hosted zone to be public, otherwise it will be inaccessible from the public internet:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Create hosted zone](images/create-hosted-zone.png ':size=500')\n",
    "\n",
    "Hosted zone is now created, and contains DNS records of type NS (Name Server) and SOA (Start of Authority):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hosted zone](images/hosted-zone.png ':size=500')\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I needed to link the domain name purchased from a third-party domain registrar with the hosted zone. To do this, I needed to map the NS records of my hosted zone to the DNS configuration of the domain purchased from the domain registrar. The DNS configuration of the purchased domain can be easily found in the domain registrar’s dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example will clarify the situation; here is how to do it with the third-party domain registrar, *Hostinger*:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The two following pictures have been retrieved from this link: https://support.hostinger.com/en/articles/1696789-how-to-change-nameservers-at-hostinger\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I went to the dashboard of the domain registrar by connecting to the customer area, then clicked to change the DNS servers of the domain name:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Change DNS Hostinger](images/change-dns-hostinger.png ':size=500')\n",

    "\n",
    "![Choose Nameservers Hostinger](images/choose-nameservers-hostinger.png ':size=500')\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I inserted in these fields the NS records of my hosted zone:\n",

    "\n",
    "![Copy NS records](images/copy-ns-records.png ':size=500')\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I thought it would be good to verify that all the public DNS in the world have the information that our domain name uses the NS of our AWS hosted zone. Next, we can get down to real business: creating S3 buckets.\n"

    "OR\n",
    "- The user enters the non-www name of the website (e.g. *cif-project.com*) in the search bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how to make a website accessible via these two names? \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Fair warning:** `S3 Buckets MUST have the same name as the corresponding website name, so that AWS can route the traffic from the website to the right Bucket!`\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting to create two S3 Buckets, I had to choose the main address and there were two choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I could make the www name (*www<nolink>.cif-project.com*) the main address of the website;\n",
    "\n",
    "OR\n",
    "\n",
    "- I could make the non-www name (*cif-project.com*) the main address of the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decision would impact on what the final URL displayed to the enduser will be.\n",
